# scsplanning

`scsplanning` implements a biconvex method for designing smooth trajectories that traverse sequences of convex sets in minimum time, while satisfying given velocity and acceleration constraints.

See the paper [A Biconvex Method for Minimum-Time Motion Planning Through Sequences of Convex Sets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18978) by Tobia Marcucci, Mathew Halm, William Yang, Dongchan Lee, and Andrew D. Marchese.
